# Serving HTML through API Gateway

These examples illustrate how to hookup an API gateway endpoint to a lambda function to render HTML on a `GET` request.

So instead of returning the default `json` from requests to an endpoint, you can display custom HTML.

This is useful for dynamic webpages and landing pages for marketing activities.
