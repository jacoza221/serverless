# Serverless Dashboard

The [Serverless Framework Dashboard](https://dashboard.serverless.com/) is a SaaS solution that augments the Serverless Framework open source CLI to provide a powerful, unified experience to develop, deploy, test, secure and monitor your serverless applications. 

The Serverless Framework free tier gives developers full access to all features included in the Serverless Framework Dashboard, but is limited to 1,000,000 function invocations per month. If you are interested in expanding your usage of the Serverless Framework beyond the free tier [contact us](https://serverless.com/enterprise/contact/) for details re available plans and pricing.
